step1_open_firewall:
The main window shows three panels:
- Left: Tree view with options (Inbound Rules, Outbound Rules, etc.)
- Center: List of rules
- Right: Actions menu (New Rule, Filter by Profile, etc.)

step2_block_port_23:
This step would show the "New Inbound Rule Wizard" on the screen, specifically:
- Rule Type: Port
- Protocol: TCP
- Port: 23
- Action: Block the connection
- Profile: Domain, Private, Public
- Name: Block Telnet Port 23
Once completed, the new rule appears in the Inbound Rules list with Action = Block.

step3_allow_port_22:
This step would show the New Inbound Rule created:
- Rule Type: Port
- Protocol: TCP
- Port: 22
- Action: Allow the connection
- Profiles: All selected
- Name: Allow SSH Port 22
Appears in the list of Inbound Rules with Action = Allow.

step4_removed_rule:
This step would show the Inbound Rules list after the "Block Telnet Port 23" rule is removed.
You can confirm:
- The "Block Telnet Port 23" no longer appears
- "Allow SSH Port 22" still remains (if not deleted)
